---

## ðŸ“‹ Code Guidelines
- Use **clear naming conventions** and keep modules self-contained
- Add **docstrings and comments** to explain logic

## âœ… Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain consistency and improve collaboration across contributions, we follow a standardized commit message format inspired by Conventional Commits.

Please structure your commits as follows:

```
<type>(optional-scope): <short description>
```

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Continuous Integration/Deployment related changes

âœ… Example:
```
feat(agent): add CRISPRDesignAgent prompt template
docs: update README with simulation sample
```

ðŸ‘‰ Consider setting up a Git pre-commit hook to enforce this automatically.
