All gRNAs were designed with NGG PAM sites for SpCas9, the most established CRISPR system with well-characterized delivery options including AAV vectors, nanoparticles, or ex vivo cell modification. gRNAs were selected for optimal GC content (50-60%), minimal self-complementarity, and filtered through computational analysis to minimize homology with human genome sequences. The LAT-targeting gRNA has moderate off-target risk due to repetitive elements in the LAT region, but offers strategic advantage for targeting viral latency.\"\n}\n```"
