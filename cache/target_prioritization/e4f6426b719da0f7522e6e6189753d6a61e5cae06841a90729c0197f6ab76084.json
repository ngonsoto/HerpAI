  "response": "# HSV-2 Therapeutic Target Analysis\n\nBased on my expertise in herpes virology, I've analyzed the HSV-2 genome to identify the most promising therapeutic targets:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Top Targets\": [\"UL30 (DNA polymerase)\", \"UL5/UL8/UL52 (Helicase-primase complex)\", \"UL39 (Ribonucleotide reductase)\"],\n  \"Rationale\": \"These targets were prioritized based on essential functions in viral replication, proven druggability with precedent antivirals, and high sequence conservation across HSV strains. UL30 is the primary target of current nucleoside analogs like acyclovir, while the helicase-primase complex offers an orthogonal mechanism of action demonstrated by clinical candidates. UL39 (ribonucleotide reductase) is essential for viral DNA synthesis in non-dividing cells and has well-characterized active sites amenable to inhibitor design.\"\n}\n```\n\nAdditional candidates that narrowly missed the top rankings include UL54 (IE gene regulatory protein), UL27 (glycoprotein B) for entry inhibition, and UL15/UL28 (terminase) for interference with viral packaging."
