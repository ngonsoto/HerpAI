Effective genetic therapy delivery must target these neural tissues while also addressing active viral replication in epithelial cells during outbreaks. The strategy below balances neural targeting with immune evasion and sufficient expression duration.\",\n  \n  \"Recommended Delivery Strategy\": {\n    \"Vector\": \"AAV9 with modified capsid for enhanced neural tropism\",\n    \"Promoter\": \"Dual promoter system: hCMV/HSV-2 latency-associated transcript (LAT) enhancer\",\n    \"Route\": \"Intradermal injection at site of recurrent outbreaks with retrograde transport\",\n    \"Supplementation\": [\"Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) co-delivery\", \"PEGylated polymer coating\", \"Cell-penetrating peptides\"]\n  },\n  \n  \"Estimated Delivery Efficiency\": \"~70-75% to neural ganglia, ~85% to epithelial tissue\",\n  \n  \"Expression Duration\": \"6-8 months for AAV-delivered construct\",\n  \n  \"Additional Notes\": \"The AAV9 serotype demonstrates strong neural tropism while the modified capsid enhances transduction of sensory neurons. The dual promoter system enables expression in both latently infected neurons (LAT enhancer) and actively replicating virus (hCMV). Retrograde transport from skin injection sites mimics the natural path of HSV-2 and targets relevant ganglia. LNP co-delivery improves initial transduction while PEGylation reduces neutralizing antibody formation. Consider readministration protocol after 6 months to maintain therapeutic levels.\"\n}\n```"
