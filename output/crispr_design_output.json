  "Rationale": "Selected genes target critical HSV-2 functions: ICP0 (immediate-early gene for viral reactivation), ICP4 (key transcriptional regulator), UL30 (DNA polymerase essential for replication), and LAT (latency-associated transcript). All gRNAs were designed with NGG PAM sites for SpCas9, the most established CRISPR system with well-characterized delivery options including AAV vectors, nanoparticles, or ex vivo cell modification. gRNAs were selected for optimal GC content (50-60%), minimal self-complementarity, and filtered through computational analysis to minimize homology with human genome sequences. The LAT-targeting gRNA has moderate off-target risk due to repetitive elements in the LAT region, but offers strategic advantage for targeting viral latency."
