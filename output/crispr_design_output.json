    }
  ],
  "Rationale": "These gRNAs target essential HSV-2 genes: ICP0 and ICP4 (immediate-early transcriptional regulators), VP16 (tegument protein critical for reactivation), UL30 (DNA polymerase for replication), and LAT (latency-associated transcript). SpCas9 (NGG PAM) offers reliable editing, while AsCas12a (TTTV PAM) provides alternative targeting. The selected sequences avoid human genome homology to minimize off-target effects, with LAT showing slightly higher risk due to its non-coding nature. AAV or lipid nanoparticle delivery systems would be optimal for targeting neuronal latent reservoirs."
