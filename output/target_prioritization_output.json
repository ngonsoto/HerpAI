{
  "Top Targets": [
    "UL30 (DNA polymerase)",
    "UL5/UL8/UL52 (Helicase-primase complex)",
    "UL39 (Ribonucleotide reductase)"
  ],
  "Rationale": "These targets were prioritized based on essential functions in viral replication, proven druggability with precedent antivirals, and high sequence conservation across HSV strains. UL30 is the primary target of current nucleoside analogs like acyclovir, while the helicase-primase complex offers an orthogonal mechanism of action demonstrated by clinical candidates. UL39 (ribonucleotide reductase) is essential for viral DNA synthesis in non-dividing cells and has well-characterized active sites amenable to inhibitor design."
