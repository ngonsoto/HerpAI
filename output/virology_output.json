  "Gene Regulation": "HSV-2 latency and reactivation involve complex regulatory mechanisms. During latency, viral gene expression is largely suppressed except for LAT, which may inhibit apoptosis in neurons and regulate chromatin structure. LAT also produces miRNAs that can downregulate expression of immediate-early genes like ICP0 and ICP4. Upon reactivation, stress pathways activate transcription factors (e.g., HCF-1, Oct-1, VP16) that initiate viral gene expression in a temporal cascade (immediate-early \u2192 early \u2192 late). Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role, with latency associated with heterochromatin marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) on viral DNA, while reactivation involves chromatin remodeling toward euchromatin (H3K4me3, acetylated histones). ICP0 functions as a key regulator by counteracting host silencing mechanisms, including disruption of ND10 nuclear bodies and inhibition of interferon responses. The balance between cellular immune surveillance and viral immune evasion strategies also contributes to the regulation of latency and reactivation."
