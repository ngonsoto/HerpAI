  "MetaData": "The following data represents the current understanding of HSV-2 latency, replication, and reactivation mechanisms. HSV-2 shares many similarities with HSV-1 in terms of gene function and regulation, though with some differences in tissue tropism and clinical manifestations. Much of our understanding about herpesvirus latency comes from studies on both HSV-1 and HSV-2.",

  "Gene Regulation": "During latency, HSV-2 gene expression is highly restricted, with LAT being the predominant transcript. LAT is thought to protect neurons from apoptosis and helps maintain the viral genome. LAT can also give rise to microRNAs that target and inhibit viral lytic genes like ICP0 and ICP4. The transition from latency to reactivation involves de-repression of viral immediate-early (IE) genes like ICP0, which acts as a transactivator by counteracting host silencing mechanisms. ICP0 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that targets host restrictive factors like ND10 nuclear bodies, helping to reactivate the viral genome. Stress-induced signaling pathways (particularly those involving JNK and c-Jun) can lead to histone modifications that promote the accessibility of viral promoters. Upon reactivation, the virus follows a temporal cascade of gene expression: immediate-early (\u03b1) \u2192 early (\u03b2) \u2192 late (\u03b3), ultimately leading to the production of infectious virions."
