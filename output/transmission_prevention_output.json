  "Novel Hypotheses": "Development of synthetic peptides that mimic the binding domains of ICP0, preventing its interaction with nuclear structures required for reactivation. These peptides could be delivered via nasal spray or topical application timed with known trigger events. Additionally, development of epigenetic modifiers specifically targeting LAT promoter regions to enforce heterochromatin formation, potentially using CRISPR-dCas9 fused to repressive chromatin modifiers delivered via engineered viral vectors with neuronal tropism."
