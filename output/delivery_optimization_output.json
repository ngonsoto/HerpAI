  "Recommended Delivery Strategy": {
    "Vector": "AAV2/8 with HSV-2 glycoprotein modifications",
    "Promoter": "Neurotropic hCMV/UL27 chimeric promoter",
    "Route": "Combined intradermal and intravaginal/perianal administration",
    "Supplementation": [
      "Cationic LNPs for immediate effect",
      "PEGylation of vector capsid",
      "Transcriptional targeting with LAT region enhancer"
    ]
  },
  "Estimated Delivery Efficiency": "~65-70%",
  "Expression Duration": "8-12 weeks for AAV component; 5-7 days for LNP component",
  "Additional Notes": "Strategy targets both latently infected neurons in dorsal root ganglia and active replication in epithelial tissues. The dual delivery approach provides immediate knockdown via LNPs while establishing longer-term expression via AAV. Tissue-specific promoters minimize off-target effects. Consider cyclophosphamide pre-treatment to reduce neutralizing antibodies in previously exposed patients."
