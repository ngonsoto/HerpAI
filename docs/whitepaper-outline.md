## Title
HerpAI: An Open-Source AI Agent Framework for Functional Cure Discovery in HSV-1 and HSV-2

## Abstract
A brief summary of the HerpAI project's mission, architecture, and its role in accelerating open, AI-driven herpes cure discovery through modular agent systems, LLM integration, and bio-simulation pipelines.

## 1. Introduction
- Problem statement: HSV latency and reactivation remain incurable.
- The need for AI-driven approaches in biomedical research.
- Existing gaps in open-source cure discovery frameworks.
- HerpAI mission under OpenBioCure.

## 2. Methodology and Architecture
### 2.1 Modular Multi-Agent System
- Virology Agent
- Target Prioritization Agent
- Drug Design Agent
- CRISPR Design Agent
- Delivery Optimization Agent
- Simulation Agent
- Output Report Generator

### 2.2 Orchestration Pipeline
- Agent chaining strategy
- Prompt templating and LLM interaction flow

### 2.3 Integration with External Tools
- RDKit, MolGPT, SwissADME, AutoDock, etc.

## 3. Key Use Cases
- Drug candidate generation (SMILES-based)
- Gene editing strategies using CRISPR/Cas systems
- Delivery efficiency simulation and optimization
- Trigger analysis (e.g., reactivation from shaving)
- Personalized preventive interventions

## 4. Results (Planned/Simulated Outputs)
- Example discovery report
- Sample molecule candidates
- Simulated delivery strategies
