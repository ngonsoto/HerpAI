Title: Herpes Simplex Virus 2 Latency-Associated Transcript (LAT) Region Mutations Do Not Identify a Role for LAT-Associated MicroRNAs in Viral Reactivation in Guinea Pig Genital Models.

Abstract:
Despite the long-standing observation that herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter deletion viruses show impaired recurrence phenotypes in relevant animal models, the mechanism by which these sequences exert this phenotypic effect is unknown. We constructed and evaluated four mutant HSV-2 isolates with targeted mutations in the LAT promoter and LAT-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) affecting (i) the LAT TATA box; (ii) the LAT ICP4-binding site; (iii) miRNA I (miR-I) and miR-II (miR-I/II), which both target ICP34.5; and (iv) miR-III, which targets ICP0. While the LAT TATA box mutant caused milder acute infections than wild-type (WT) virus, there was no difference in the recurrence phenotype between these viruses. LAT and miRNA expression during latency was not impaired by this mutation, suggesting that other promoter elements may be more important for latent HSV-2 LAT expression. Mutation of the LAT ICP4-binding site also did not cause an
