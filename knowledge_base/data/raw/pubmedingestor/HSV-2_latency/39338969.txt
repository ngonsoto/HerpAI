Title: Recent Advances in the Study of Alphaherpesvirus Latency and Reactivation: Novel Guidance for the Design of Herpesvirus Live Vector Vaccines.

Abstract:
Alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), infect a diverse array of hosts, spanning both humans and animals. Alphaherpesviruses have developed a well-adapted relationship with their hosts through long-term evolution. Some alphaherpesviruses exhibit a typical neurotropic characteristic, which has garnered widespread attention and in-depth research. Virus latency involves the retention of viral genomes without producing infectious viruses. However, under stress, this can be reversed, resulting in lytic infection. Such reactivation events can lead to recurrent infections, manifesting as diseases like herpes labialis, genital herpes, and herpes zoster. Reactivation is a complex process influenced by both viral and host factors, and identifying how latency and reactivation work is vital to developing new antiviral therapies. Recent research highlights a complex interaction among the virus, neurons, and the immune system in regulating alphaherpesvirus latency and reactivation. Neurotropic alphaherpesviruses can breach host barriers to infect neurons, proliferate extensively within their cell bodies, and establish latent infections or spread further. Whether infecting neurons or spreading further, the virus undergoes transmission along axons or dendrites, making this process an indispensable part of the viral life cycle and a critical factor influencing the virus's invasion of the nervous system. Research on the transmission process of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses within neurons can not only deepen our understanding of the virus but can also facilitate the targeted development of corresponding vaccines. This review concentrates on the relationship between the transmission, latency, and activation of alphaherpesviruses within neurons, summarizes recent advancements in the field, and discusses how these findings can inform the design of live virus vaccines for alphaherpesviruses.
