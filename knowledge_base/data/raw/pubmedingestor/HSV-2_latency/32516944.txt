Title: Vaccination Route as a Determinant of Protective Antibody Responses against Herpes Simplex Virus.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are significant global health problems associated with mucosal and neurologic disease. Prior experimental vaccines primarily elicited neutralizing antibodies targeting glycoprotein D (gD), but those that advanced to clinical efficacy trials have failed. Preclinical studies with an HSV-2 strain deleted in gD (ΔgD-2) administered subcutaneously demonstrated that it elicited a high titer, weakly neutralizing antibodies that activated Fcg receptors to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and completely protected mice against lethal disease and latency following vaginal or skin challenge with HSV-1 or HSV-2. Vaccine efficacy, however, may be impacted by dose and route of immunization. Thus, the current studies were designed to compare immunogenicity and efficacy following different routes of vaccination with escalating doses of ΔgD-2. We compared ΔgD-2 with two other candidates: recombinant gD protein combined with aluminum hydroxide and monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvants and a replication-defective virus deleted in two proteins involved in viral replication,
