Title: Clinical Management of Herpes Simplex Virus Keratitis.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Additionally, up to 90% of the population in some countries is seropositive for HSV. HSV can cause a wide spectrum of ocular disease ranging from blepharitis to retinitis. Although the initial clinical expressions of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar, HSV-2 has been reported more frequently in association with recurrent HSV disease. Besides irreversible vision loss from keratitis, HSV also causes encephalitis and genital forms of the disease. Despite these statistics, there remains no vaccine against HSV. Current treatment therapies for related ocular diseases include the use of oral and topical antivirals and topical corticosteroids. While effective in many cases, they fail to address the latency and elimination of the virus, making it ineffective in addressing recurrences, a factor which increases the risk of vision loss. As such, there is a need for continued research of other potential therapeutic targets. This review utilized several published articles regarding the manifestations of HSV keratitis, antiviral immune responses to HSV infection, and clinical management of HSV keratitis. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the host-virus interaction in HSV infections, as well as highlighting the current and potential antiviral therapeutics.
