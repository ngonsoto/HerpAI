Title: Herpesvirus Infections Potentiated by Biologics.

Abstract:
Herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) maintain lifelong latency in the host after primary infection and can reactivate periodically either as asymptomatic viral shedding or as clinical disease. Immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, may increase frequency and severity of herpesvirus reactivation and infection. Licensed biologics are reviewed regarding their risks of potentiating HSV, VZV, and CMV reactivation and infection. Approaches to prophylaxis against HSV, VZV, and CMV infection or reactivation are discussed.
