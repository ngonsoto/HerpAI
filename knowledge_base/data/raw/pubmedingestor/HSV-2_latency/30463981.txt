Title: Increased Frequency of Virus Shedding by Herpes Simplex Virus 2-Infected Guinea Pigs in the Absence of CD4(+) T Lymphocytes.

Abstract:
Reactivation of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) results in infection of epithelial cells at the neuro-epithelial junction and shedding of virus at the epithelial surface. Virus shedding can occur in either the presence or absence of clinical disease and is usually of short duration, although the shedding frequency varies among individuals. The basis for host control of virus shedding is not well understood, although adaptive immune mechanisms are thought to play a central role. To determine the importance of CD4
