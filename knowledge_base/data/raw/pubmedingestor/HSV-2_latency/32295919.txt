Title: A Single-Cycle Glycoprotein D Deletion Viral Vaccine Candidate, ΔgD-2, Elicits Polyfunctional Antibodies That Protect against Ocular Herpes Simplex Virus.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a leading cause of infectious blindness, highlighting the need for effective vaccines. A single-cycle HSV-2 strain with the deletion of glycoprotein D, ΔgD-2, completely protected mice from HSV-1 and HSV-2 skin or vaginal disease and prevented latency following active or passive immunization in preclinical studies. The antibodies functioned primarily by activating Fc receptors to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The ability of ADCC to protect the immune-privileged eye, however, may differ from skin or vaginal infections. Thus, the current studies were designed to compare active and passive immunization with ΔgD-2 versus an adjuvanted gD subunit vaccine (rgD-2) in a primary lethal ocular murine model. ΔgD-2 provided significantly greater protection than rgD-2 following a two-dose vaccine regimen, although both vaccines were protective compared to an uninfected cell lysate. However, only immune serum from ΔgD-2-vaccinated, but not rgD-2-vaccinated, mice provided significant protection against lethality in passive transfer studies. The significantly greater passive protection afforded by ΔgD-2 persisted after controlling for the total amount of HSV-specific IgG in the transferred serum. The antibodies elicited by rgD-2 had significantly higher neutralizing titers, whereas those elicited by ΔgD-2 had significantly more C1q binding and Fc gamma receptor activation, a surrogate for ADCC function. Together, the findings suggest ADCC is protective in the eye and that nonneutralizing antibodies elicited by ΔgD-2 provide greater protection than neutralizing antibodies elicited by rgD-2 against primary ocular HSV disease. The findings support advancement of vaccines, including ΔgD-2, that elicit polyfunctional antibody responses.
