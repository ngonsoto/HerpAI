Title: Immunisation Using Novel DNA Vaccine Encoding Virus Membrane Fusion Complex and Chemokine Genes Shows High Protection from HSV-2.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 infections cause high unmet disease burdens worldwide. Mainly HSV-2 causes persistent sexually transmitted disease, fatal neonatal disease and increased transmission of HIV/AIDS. Thus, there is an urgent requirement to develop effective vaccines. We developed nucleic acid vaccines encoding a novel virus entry complex stabilising cell membrane fusion, 'virus-like membranes', VLM. Two dose intramuscular immunisations using DNA expression plasmids in a guinea pig model gave 100% protection against acute disease and significantly reduced virus replication after virus intravaginal challenge. There was also reduced establishment of latency within the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, but recurrent disease and recurrent virus shedding remained. To increase cellular immunity and protect against recurrent disease, cDNA encoding an inhibitor of chemokine receptors on T regulatory cells was added and compared to chemokine CCL5 effects. Immunisation including this novel human chemokine gene, newly defined splice variant from an endogenous virus genome, 'virokine immune therapeutic', VIT, protected most guinea pigs from recurrent disease and reduced recurrent virus shedding distinct from a gD protein vaccine similar to that previously evaluated in clinical trials. All DNA vaccines induced significant neutralising antibodies and warrant evaluation for new therapeutic treatments.
