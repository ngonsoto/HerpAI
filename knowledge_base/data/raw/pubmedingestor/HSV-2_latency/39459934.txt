Title: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Blocks IFN-β Production through the Viral UL24 N-Terminal Domain-Mediated Inhibition of IRF-3 Phosphorylation.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted virus, the cause of genital herpes, and its infection can increase the risk of HIV-1 infection. After initial infection, HSV-2 can establish lifelong latency within the nervous system, which is likely associated with the virus-mediated immune evasion. In this study, we found that HSV-2 UL24 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-β promoter and the production of IFN-β at both mRNA and protein levels. Of importance, the inhibitory effect of HSV-2 on IFN-β production was significantly impaired in the context of HSV-2 infection when UL24 was knocked down. Additional studies revealed that, although the full-length HSV-2 UL24 affected cell cycle and viability to some extent, its N-terminal 1-202AA domain showed no obvious cytotoxicity while its C-terminal 201-281 AA domain had a minimal impact on cell viability. Further studies showed that the N-terminal 1-202 AA domain of HSV-2 UL24 (HSV-2 UL24-N) was the main functional region responsible for the inhibition of IFN-β production mediated by HSV-2 UL24. This domain significantly suppressed the activity of RIG-IN, MAVS, TBK-1, IKK-ε, or the IRF-3/5D-activated IFN-β promoter. Mechanistically, HSV-2 UL24-N suppressed IRF-3 phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of IFN-β production. The findings of this study highlight the significance of HSV-2 UL24 in inhibiting IFN-β production, revealing two potential roles of UL24 during HSV-2 infection: facilitating immune evasion and inducing cell cycle arrest.
