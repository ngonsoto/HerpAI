Title: Genital Herpes Infection: Progress and Problems.

Abstract:
Genital herpes (GH) is a sexually transmitted infection causing recurrent, self-limited genital, buttock, and thigh ulcerations. Symptoms range from unrecognized or mild to severe with frequent recurrences. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type-1 or type-2 cause GH. HSV establishes latency in sacral ganglia and causes lifelong infection. Viral reactivation leads to genital ulceration or asymptomatic shedding which may lead to transmission. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause fulminant hepatitis and neonatal transmission. Severe and atypical manifestations are seen in immunocompromised people. Guanosine analogs treat symptoms and prevent recurrences, shedding, and transmission. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are in development.
