Title: Ethanol extract from Artemisia argyi leaves inhibits HSV-1 infection by destroying the viral envelope.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widely disseminated virus that establishes latency in the brain and causes occasional but fatal herpes simplex encephalitis. Currently, acyclovir (ACV) is the main clinical drug used in the treatment of HSV-1 infection, and the failure of therapy in immunocompromised patients caused by ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains necessitates the requirement to develop novel anti-HSV-1 drugs. Artemisia argyi, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been historically used to treat inflammation, bacterial infection, and cancer. In this study, we demonstrated the antiviral effect and mechanism of ethanol extract of A. argyi leaves (hereafter referred to as 'AEE'). We showed that AEE at 10 μg/ml exhibits potent antiviral effects on both normal and ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains. AEE also inhibited the infection of HSV-2, rotavirus, and influenza virus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that AEE destroys the membrane integrity of HSV-1 viral particles, resulting in impaired viral attachment and penetration. Furthermore, mass spectrometry assay identified 12 major components of AEE, among which two new flavones, deoxysappanone B 7,3'-dimethyl ether, and 3,7-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyflavone, exhibited the highest binding affinity to HSV-1 glycoprotein gB at the surface site critical for gB-gH-gL interaction and gB-mediated membrane fusion, suggesting their involvement in inactivating virions. Therefore, A. argyi is an important source of antiviral drugs, and the AEE may be a potential novel antiviral agent against HSV-1 infection.
