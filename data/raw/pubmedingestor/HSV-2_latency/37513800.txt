Title: Mouse Models for Human Herpesviruses.

Abstract:
More than one hundred herpesviruses have been isolated from different species so far, with nine infecting humans. Infections with herpesviruses are characterized by life-long latency and represent a significant challenge for human health. To investigate the consequences of infections and identify novel treatment options, in vivo models are of particular relevance. The mouse has emerged as an economical small animal model to investigate herpesvirus infections. However, except for herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2), human herpesviruses cannot infect mice. Three natural herpesviruses have been identified in mice: mouse-derived cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), and mouse roseolovirus (MRV). These orthologues are broadly used to investigate herpesvirus infections within the natural host. In the last few decades, immunocompromised mouse models have been developed, allowing the functional engraftment of various human cells and tissues. These xenograft mice represent valuable model systems to investigate human-restricted viruses, making them particularly relevant for herpesvirus research. In this review, we describe the various mouse models used to study human herpesviruses, thereby highlighting their potential and limitations. Emphasis is laid on xenograft mouse models, covering the development and refinement of immune-compromised mice and their application in herpesvirus research.
