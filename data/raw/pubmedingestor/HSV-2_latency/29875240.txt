Title: In Vivo Knockdown of the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Latency-Associated Transcript Reduces Reactivation from Latency.

Abstract:
During herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, most viral genes are silenced, with the exception of one region of the genome encoding the latency-associated transcript (LAT). This long noncoding RNA was originally described as having a role in enhancing HSV-1 reactivation. However, subsequent evidence showing that the LAT blocked apoptosis and promoted efficient establishment of latency suggested that its effects on reactivation were secondary to establishment. Here, we utilized an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver a LAT-targeting hammerhead ribozyme to HSV-1-infected neurons of rabbits after the establishment of HSV-1 latency. The rabbits were then induced to reactivate latent HSV-1. Using this model, we show that decreasing LAT levels in neurons following the establishment of latency reduced the ability of the virus to reactivate. This demonstrates that the HSV-1 LAT RNA has a role in reactivation that is independent of its function in establishment of latency. In addition, these results suggest the potential of AAV vectors expressing LAT-targeting ribozymes as a potential therapy for recurrent HSV disease such as herpes stromal keratitis, a leading cause of infectious blindness.
