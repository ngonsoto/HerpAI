Title: Characterization of the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Tegument Proteins That Bind to gE/gI and US9, Which Promote Assembly of HSV and Transport into Neuronal Axons.

Abstract:
The herpes simplex virus (HSV) heterodimer gE/gI and another membrane protein, US9, which has neuron-specific effects, promote the anterograde transport of virus particles in neuronal axons. Deletion of both HSV gE and US9 blocks the assembly of enveloped particles in the neuronal cytoplasm, which explains why HSV virions do not enter axons. Cytoplasmic envelopment depends upon interactions between viral membrane proteins and tegument proteins that encrust capsids. We report that tegument protein UL16 is unstable, i.e., rapidly degraded, in neurons infected with a gE-/US9- double mutant. Immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates of HSV-infected neurons showed that UL16 and three other tegument proteins, namely, VP22, UL11, and UL21, bound either to gE or gI. All four of these tegument proteins were also pulled down with US9. In neurons transfected with tegument proteins and gE/gI or US9, there was good evidence that VP22 and UL16 bound directly to US9 and gE/gI. However, there were lower quantities of these tegument proteins that coprecipitated with gE/gI and US9 from transfected cells than those of infected cells. This apparently relates to a matrix of several different tegument proteins formed in infected cells that bind to gE/gI and US9. In cells transfected with individual tegument proteins, this matrix is less prevalent. Similarly, coprecipitation of gE/gI and US9 was observed in HSV-infected cells but not in transfected cells, which argued against direct US9-gE/gI interactions. These studies suggest that gE/gI and US9 binding to these tegument proteins has neuron-specific effects on virus HSV assembly, a process required for axonal transport of enveloped particles.
