Title: Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Infection of Neuronal and Non-Neuronal Cells Elicits Specific Innate Immune Responses and Immune Evasion Mechanisms.

Abstract:
Alphaherpesviruses (α-HV) are a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses which cause many human and animal diseases. There are three human α-HVs: Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). All α-HV have evolved multiple strategies to suppress or exploit host cell innate immune signaling pathways to aid in their infections. All α-HVs initially infect epithelial cells (primary site of infection), and later spread to infect innervating sensory neurons. As with all herpesviruses, α-HVs have both a lytic (productive) and latent (dormant) stage of infection. During the lytic stage, the virus rapidly replicates in epithelial cells before it is cleared by the immune system. In contrast, latent infection in host neurons is a life-long infection. Upon infection of mucosal epithelial cells, herpesviruses immediately employ a variety of cellular mechanisms to evade host detection during active replication. Next, infectious viral progeny bud from infected cells and fuse to neuronal axonal terminals. Here, the nucleocapsid is transported
