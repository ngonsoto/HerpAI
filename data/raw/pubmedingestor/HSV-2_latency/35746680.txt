Title: Impact of Cultured Neuron Models on α-Herpesvirus Latency Research.

Abstract:
A signature trait of neurotropic α-herpesviruses (α-HV) is their ability to establish stable non-productive infections of peripheral neurons termed latency. This specialized gene expression program is the foundation of an evolutionarily successful strategy to ensure lifelong persistence in the host. Various physiological stresses can induce reactivation in a subset of latently-infected neurons allowing a new cycle of viral productive cycle gene expression and synthesis of infectious virus. Recurring reactivation events ensure transmission of the virus to new hosts and contributes to pathogenesis. Efforts to define the molecular basis of α-HV latency and reactivation have been notoriously difficult because the neurons harboring latent virus in humans and in experimentally infected live-animal models, are rare and largely inaccessible to study. Increasingly, researchers are turning to cultured neuron infection models as simpler experimental platforms from which to explore latency and reactivation at the molecular level. In this review, I reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of existing neuronal models and briefly summarize the important mechanistic insights these models have provided. I also discuss areas where prioritization will help to ensure continued progress and integration.
