Title: HSV-1 miRNAs are post-transcriptionally edited in latently infected human ganglia.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus 1 is an important human pathogen that has been intensively studied for many decades. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating its establishment, maintenance, and reactivation from latency are poorly understood. Here, we show that HSV-1-encoded miR-H2 is post-transcriptionally edited in latently infected human tissues. Hyperediting of viral miRNAs increases the targeting potential of these miRNAs and may play an important role in regulating latency. We show that the edited miR-H2 can target ICP4, an essential viral protein. Interestingly, we found no evidence of hyperediting of its homolog, miR-H2, which is expressed by the closely related virus HSV-2. The discovery of post-translational modifications of viral miRNA in the latency phase suggests that these processes may also be important for other non-coding viral RNA in the latency phase, including the intron LAT, which in turn may be crucial for understanding the biology of this virus.
