Title: Herpes Simplex Virus 2 Counteracts Neurite Outgrowth Repulsion during Infection in a Nerve Growth Factor-Dependent Manner.

Abstract:
During primary infection, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) replicates in epithelial cells and enters neurites to infect neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Growth factors and attractive and repulsive directional cues influence neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival. We hypothesized that HSV-2 modulates the activity of such cues to increase neurite outgrowth. To test this hypothesis, we exposed sensory neurons to nerve growth factor (NGF) and mock- or HSV-2-infected HEK-293T cells, since they express repellents of neurite outgrowth. We show that HEK-293T cells secrete factors that inhibit neurite outgrowth, while infection with HSV-2 strains MS and 333 reduces this repelling phenotype, increasing neurite numbers. The HSV-2-mediated restoration of neurite outgrowth required the activity of NGF. In the absence of infection, however, NGF did not overcome the repulsion mediated by HEK-293T cells. We previously showed that
