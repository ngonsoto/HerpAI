Title: Colonization of peripheral ganglia by herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) infect and establish latency in neurons of the peripheral nervous system to persist lifelong in the host and to cause recurrent disease. During primary infection, HSV replicates in epithelial cells in the mucosa and skin and then infects neurites, highly dynamic structures that grow or retract in the presence of attracting or repelling cues, respectively. Following retrograde transport in neurites, HSV establishes latency in the neuronal nucleus. Viral and cellular proteins participate in the chromatinization of the HSV genome that regulates gene expression, persistence, and reactivation. HSV-2 modulates neurite outgrowth during primary infection and upon reactivation, probably to facilitate infection and survival of neurons. Whether HSV-1 modulates neurite outgrowth and the underlying mechanism is currently under investigation. This review deals with HSV-1 and HSV-2 colonization of peripheral neurons, with a focus on the modulation of neurite outgrowth by these viruses.
