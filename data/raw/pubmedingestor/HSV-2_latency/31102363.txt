Title: [Mechanisms of herpes simplex virus latency and reactivation].

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus (HSV), including HSV-1 and HSV-2, is an important pathogen that can cause many diseases. Usually these diseases are recurrent and incurable. After lytic infection on the surface of peripheral mucosa, HSV can enter sensory neurons and establish latent infection during which viral replication ceases. Moreover, latent virus can re-enter the replication cycle by reactivation and return to peripheral tissues to start recurrent infection. This ability to escape host immune surveillance during latent infection and to spread during reactivation is a viral survival strategy and the fundamental reason why no drug can completely eradicate the virus at present. Although there are many studies on latency and reactivation of HSV, and much progress has been made, many specific mechanisms of the process remain obscure or even controversial due to the complexity of this process and the limitations of research models. This paper reviews the major results of research on HSV latency and reactivation, and discusses future research directions in this field. 单纯疱疹病毒（HSV，包括HSV-1和HSV-2）是引起多种疾病的重要病原，通常这些疾病具有反复发作和无法根治的特点。HSV在外周黏膜组织表面进行增殖式感染后，可进入感觉神经元并建立无复制的潜伏感染。潜伏的病毒还可以通过激活的方式重新进入复制周期，并回到外周组织进行复发感染。这种既能通过潜伏逃避宿主免疫攻击又能在激活过程中传播的能力是该病毒高超的生存策略，也是当前任何药物无法彻底消灭该病毒的根本原因。虽然HSV潜伏与激活的研究众多，且不断有新的研究进展，但由于潜伏和激活过程本身的复杂性和研究模型的局限性，其中很多具体过程相关机制依然不明确，甚至常有争议。本文重点梳理HSV-1潜伏和激活的主要研究成果，并讨论其发展趋势。
