Title: Mechanisms of Endogenous HIV-1 Reactivation by Endocervical Epithelial Cells.

Abstract:
Pharmacological HIV-1 reactivation to reverse latent infection has been extensively studied. However, HIV-1 reactivation also occurs naturally, as evidenced by occasional low-level viremia ("viral blips") during antiretroviral treatment (ART). Clarifying where blips originate from and how they happen could provide clues to stimulate latency reversal more effectively and safely or to prevent viral rebound following ART cessation. We studied HIV-1 reactivation in the female genital tract, a dynamic anatomical target for HIV-1 infection throughout all disease stages. We found that primary endocervical epithelial cells from several women reactivated HIV-1 from latently infected T cells. The endocervical cells' HIV-1 reactivation capacity further increased upon Toll-like receptor 3 stimulation with poly(I·C) double-stranded RNA or infection with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). Notably, acyclovir did not eliminate HSV-2-induced HIV-1 reactivation. While endocervical epithelial cells secreted large amounts of several cytokines and chemokines, especially tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), CCL3, CCL4, and CCL20, their HIV-1 reactivation capacity was almost completely blocked by TNF-α neutralization alone. Thus, immunosurveillance activities by columnar epithelial cells in the endocervix can cause endogenous HIV-1 reactivation, which may contribute to viral blips during ART or rebound following ART interruption.
