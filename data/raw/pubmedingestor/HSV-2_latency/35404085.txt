Title: Neuronal miR-138 Represses HSV-2 Lytic Infection by Regulating Viral and Host Genes with Mechanistic Differences from HSV-1.

Abstract:
Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) establishes latent infection in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after productive (lytic) infection in peripheral tissues. A neuron-specific microRNA, miR-138, favors HSV-1 latency by repressing viral
